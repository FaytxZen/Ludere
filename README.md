We are developing a web application that users may use to track their consumption of visual media, and keeping a catalog of present visual media. The application will be user driven, providing support for user features such as profiles, data visualization, and recommendations. The catalog will encompas a range Television Shows and Movies, and will provide details such as a summary, release date, cast listing, crew listing, and more.
